# Title

   Frontend Assignment: Implement a Charting Library in React.js

## Objective

    Create a React.js application that displays a chart using a charting library. The chart should support timeframe breakdown, timeframe zooming, and interactive click events. The chart data will be provided in JSON format.

## Tech Stack

    React js, React Hooks, Recharts

## Completion Instructions

### Functionality

#### Must Have

    a chart must have timeframe breakdown, zooming, and click events

#### Nice to Have

    Implement additional features such as data filtering, custom tooltips, or animations.

### Guidelines to develop a project

#### Must Have

*   Initialize a new React.js project.
*   Choose a charting library that supports timeframe breakdown, zooming, and click events.
*   Create a JSON file or an endpoint to serve chart data. The JSON data should include timestamps and values to be plotted. Make sure the data has over 100 points.
*   Display the chart using the selected charting library.
*   Implement timeframe breakdown (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly views).
*   Enable timeframe zooming to allow users to zoom in/out on specific time periods.
*   Add click event handlers to display details of the clicked data point (e.g., show a tooltip or a modal with more information).
*   Create a simple UI with buttons or dropdowns to switch between different timeframe breakdowns (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
*   Ensure the UI is responsive and user-friendly.

#### Nice to Have

    Use TypeScript for type safety and better code quality.

### Submission Instructions

#### Must Have

*   Provide a link to the GitHub repository containing the source code.
*   Include a README file with instructions on how to run the project locally.
*   Provide the deployment link to the live application.

#### Nice to Have

    List the suggested instructions to follow while submitting the project mentioned in the Assignment, if any
